## Common Causes of Huawei S7-701u Charging Problems
 
There are several factors that can affect the charging performance of your Huawei S7-701u tablet. Some of them are:
 
- **Damaged or faulty charger.** If your charger is broken or not compatible with your tablet, it may not deliver enough power or voltage to charge your device. You can check if your charger is working by plugging it into another device or using a different charger with your tablet.
- **Damaged or faulty USB cable.** If your USB cable is worn out, frayed, or bent, it may not connect properly with your charger or your tablet. This can result in slow or no charging. You can check if your USB cable is working by using a different cable with your charger or your tablet.
- **Damaged or dirty charging port.** If your charging port is damaged by water, dust, or debris, it may not make a good contact with your USB cable. This can also result in slow or no charging. You can check if your charging port is clean by using a toothpick or a cotton swab to gently remove any dirt or lint from the port.
- **Software glitches.** Sometimes, software issues can interfere with the charging process of your tablet. For example, if your tablet is running low on memory or has a lot of background apps running, it may consume more power than usual and slow down the charging speed. You can try to fix this by closing any unnecessary apps, clearing the cache, or restarting your tablet.
- **Battery problems.** If your battery is old, damaged, or swollen, it may not hold a charge well or at all. This can cause your tablet to shut down unexpectedly or not turn on at all.
