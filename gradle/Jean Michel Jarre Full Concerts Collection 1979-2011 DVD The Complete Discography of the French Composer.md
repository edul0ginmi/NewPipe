### Some Highlights of the Collection
 
- The Place de la Concorde concert (1979): This was Jarre's first major outdoor concert and it attracted a record-breaking audience of more than one million people. It was also the first time that he used lasers and projections as part of his show. The concert was a celebration of the French Revolution bicentenary and it featured songs from his albums OxygÃ¨ne and Ãquinoxe.
- The China concerts (1981): Jarre was the first Western musician officially invited to perform in China after the Cultural Revolution. He played five concerts in Beijing and Shanghai, which were attended by more than 120,000 people. He also collaborated with local musicians and incorporated traditional Chinese instruments into his music. The concerts were a cultural exchange and a symbol of friendship between France and China.
- The Rendez-Vous Houston concert (1986): This was Jarre's tribute to NASA and the astronauts who died in the Challenger space shuttle disaster. He played in front of a crowd of 1.3 million people and used the skyscrapers of downtown Houston as a giant screen for his projections. He also performed a special piece called Rendez-Vous IV with astronaut Ron McNair playing saxophone from space, but the plan was cancelled due to the tragedy.
- The Destination Docklands concert (1988): This was Jarre's most ambitious and complex concert to date. He transformed the Royal Victoria Dock in London into a futuristic cityscape with giant cranes, scaffolding, water screens and fireworks. He played songs from his album Revolutions, which was inspired by the industrial revolution and the social changes it brought. The concert faced many difficulties due to bad weather, technical problems and safety issues.
- The Paris La DÃ©fense concert (1990): This was Jarre's celebration of the French Revolution bicentenary and it attracted a Guinness World Record audience of 2.5 million people. He played on a 1.2 km long stage at the foot of the Grande Arche de la DÃ©fense, surrounded by lasers, searchlights and pyrotechnics. He performed songs from his album Waiting for Cousteau, which was dedicated to the oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
- The OxygÃ¨ne Tour (1997): This was Jarre's first indoor tour and it marked the 20th anniversary of his breakthrough album OxygÃ¨ne. He played in various venues across Europe and America, using only analog synthesizers and vintage equipment. He recreated the original sound and atmosphere of OxygÃ¨ne, while adding some new arrangements and improvisations.
- The Moscow concert (1997): This was Jarre's tribute to 8cf37b1e13
